The problem: We're storing a raw pointer with transmuted lifetime, and the Drop
might not be happening correctly to trigger raylib's EndDrawing + frame timing.

Solution: Use a flag-based approach where we track if we're in drawing mode,
and ensure proper synchronous dropping of the RaylibDrawHandle.

Better yet: Just use the Option<RaylibDrawHandle> field that already exists!
