Options to fix the flickering:

Option 1: Remove sleep entirely, rely on VSync
- Pro: Background is stable
- Con: Text might flicker
- Con: FPS not limited

Option 2: Only sleep if we're WAY ahead (e.g., more than 5ms early)
- Pro: Won't interfere with VSync for normal rendering
- Con: Might not limit FPS well enough

Option 3: Use a much smaller sleep (like 1ms) just to yield CPU
- Pro: Gives up CPU without blocking too long
- Con: Might not be enough timing control

Let's try Option 2 first - only sleep if we have significant time left
