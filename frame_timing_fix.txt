The issue: raylib-rs's RaylibDrawHandle Drop doesn't enforce frame timing.

Solution: Add manual frame timing in Rust using std::thread::sleep

Steps:
1. Add thread_local for target_fps and last_frame_time
2. Store target FPS when set_target_fps is called  
3. In end_drawing, calculate elapsed time and sleep if needed
