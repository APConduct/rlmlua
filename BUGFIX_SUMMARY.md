# Bug Fix Summary - Window Rendering and Input Responsiveness

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Window Flashing Instead of Rendering (CRITICAL BUG)

**Problem:**
The basic window example was just flashing the background color instead of properly rendering the window with text and graphics. The window would open but not display any content correctly.

**Root Cause:**
The Lua API exposed methods like `begin_drawing()`, `end_drawing()`, `clear_background()`, and `draw_text()` that users were calling on the window object, but these methods were **not implemented** in the Rust code. The `LuaRaylib` struct only had a `draw_frame()` callback-based method, not the direct drawing methods.

**Solution:**
Added the following methods to `LuaRaylib` in `src/lib.rs`:
- `begin_drawing()` - Starts a drawing frame and stores the draw handle in thread-local storage
- `end_drawing()` - Ends the drawing frame and cleans up the draw handle
- `clear_background(color)` - Clears the screen with a color
- `draw_text(text, x, y, size, color)` - Draws text
- `draw_rectangle(x, y, width, height, color)` - Draws a rectangle
- `draw_circle(x, y, radius, color)` - Draws a circle
- `draw_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)` - Draws a line
- `draw_pixel(x, y, color)` - Draws a pixel
- `draw_rectangle_lines(x, y, width, height, color)` - Draws rectangle outline
- `draw_circle_lines(x, y, radius, color)` - Draws circle outline

These methods use the thread-local `DRAW_HANDLE` to access the raylib drawing context safely.

### 2. Unresponsive Input (ESC Key Requires Multiple Presses)

**Problem:**
The ESC key and other input events required multiple presses to register. Users had to press ESC several times to close the window.

**Root Cause:**
Input events were being polled **multiple times per frame**, which cleared the input state each time:
1. Once in `window_should_close()` (in the while loop condition)
2. Once explicitly in user code (in some examples)
3. Once in `begin_drawing()`

Each call to `poll_input_events()` clears the previous input state, causing key presses to be missed.

**Solution:**
Implemented a **single-poll-per-frame** pattern:
- Input events are polled exactly once per frame in `window_should_close()`
- Removed automatic polling from `begin_drawing()`
- All input checks after `window_should_close()` see the same consistent input state
- Added optional `poll_input_events()` method for advanced users who need manual control

### 3. Missing RAYWHITE Color Constant

**Problem:**
The common raylib color `RAYWHITE` was not defined in the colors table, causing errors in examples.

**Solution:**
Added `RAYWHITE` color constant (RGB: 245, 245, 245, 255) to the color registry in `src/lib.rs`.

### 4. Incorrect Library Extension in install_local.sh

**Problem:**
The `install_local.sh` script had syntax errors:
- Duplicate `fi` statement
- Incorrect `INSTALL_NAME` for macOS (was setting `.dylib` instead of `.so`)

**Solution:**
- Removed duplicate `fi` statement
- Corrected `INSTALL_NAME` to always be `raylib_lua.so` for Lua compatibility on all platforms
- The actual library file (`librlmlua.dylib` or `librlmlua.so`) is copied to the correct name for Lua to load

## Files Modified

### Core Library
- `src/lib.rs` - Added drawing methods to `LuaRaylib`, fixed input polling pattern

### Installation
- `install_local.sh` - Fixed OS detection and library naming

### Examples
- `examples/01_basic_window.lua` - Added documentation comments about input polling
- `examples/test_render.lua` - Created test for verifying rendering works
- `examples/test_input.lua` - Created test for input detection
- `examples/02_input_demo.lua` - Created comprehensive input demo

### Documentation
- `INPUT_HANDLING.md` - Complete guide to input handling pattern
- `BUGFIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Testing Performed

1. **Basic Window Test**: Verified that `examples/01_basic_window.lua` renders correctly with text
2. **Render Test**: Created `test_render.lua` to verify all drawing primitives work
3. **Input Test**: Created test scripts to verify ESC key responsiveness

## API Design Philosophy

The fix maintains support for **two drawing patterns**:

### Pattern 1: Direct Drawing (Traditional Raylib Style)
```lua
while not window:window_should_close() do
    window:begin_drawing()
    window:clear_background(rl.colors.RAYWHITE)
    window:draw_text("Hello", 100, 100, 20, rl.colors.BLACK)
    window:end_drawing()
end
```

### Pattern 2: Callback-Based (mlua-Style)
```lua
while not window:window_should_close() do
    window:draw_frame(function()
        -- Drawing code here
    end)
end
```

Both patterns are now fully functional and use the same underlying implementation.

## Input Handling Pattern

**Key Rule**: Input is polled once per frame when `window_should_close()` is called.

```lua
while not window:window_should_close() do
    -- Input already polled here ^^^
    
    -- All input checks use the same state
    if window:is_key_pressed("SPACE") then
        -- Handle input
    end
    
    window:begin_drawing()
    -- Drawing code
    window:end_drawing()
end
```

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Single input poll per frame reduces unnecessary system calls
- **Neutral**: Drawing methods use thread-local storage (zero-cost abstraction in Rust)
- **No regressions**: All existing code patterns still work

## Breaking Changes

**None** - The changes are fully backward compatible. Both drawing patterns work.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding more drawing primitives (triangles, polygons, etc.)
2. Add texture loading and drawing support
3. Implement text measurement functions
4. Add more comprehensive input examples
5. Consider adding gamepad/controller support
6. Add audio support
7. Document the thread-local pattern for advanced users

## Migration Guide

If you have existing code that polls input manually:

### Before (causes missed inputs):
```lua
while not window:window_should_close() do
    window:poll_input_events()  -- Remove this
    -- rest of code
end
```

### After (correct):
```lua
while not window:window_should_close() do
    -- Input already polled automatically
    -- rest of code
end
```
